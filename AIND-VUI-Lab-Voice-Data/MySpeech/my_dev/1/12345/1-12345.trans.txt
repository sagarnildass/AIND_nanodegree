1-12345-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
1-12345-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
1-12345-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
1-12345-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
1-12345-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
1-12345-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
1-12345-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
1-12345-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
